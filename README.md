## Introduction

Project Browser (PB) makes it possible to find modules within your Drupal installation. It removes the need to leave the admin UI and visit Drupal.org to find and install modules. It is build to be a more intuitive experience than the module listing on Drupal.org. Only modules compatible with your site are displayed, and enhanced filtering capabilities provide a streamlined view of projects.

Project Browser queries the Drupal.org API in real-time to ensure that the content is easily accessible and up to date. (You may write a plugin to switch using the Drupal API for your own backend if you wish.)

Our goal is to make it easier to find and install modules for people new to Drupal and site builders. Developers will also find this valuable since it provides the composer commands to get the modules.
